## Release

To release a new version:

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a tests, coverage, & linting sanity check
2. Update the version number in `version.rb`
3. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` again as a secondary check, and to update `Gemfile.lock`
4. Run `git commit -am "🔖 Prepare release v<VERSION>"` to commit the changes
   a. NOTE: Remember to [check the build][🧪build]!
5. Run `rake build`
6. Run [`bin/checksums`](https://github.com/rubygems/guides/pull/325) to create SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksums
   a. Checksums will be committed automatically by the script
7. Run `rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org][💎rubygems]

NOTE: You will need to have a public key in `certs/`, and list your cert in the
`gemspec`, in order to sign the new release.
